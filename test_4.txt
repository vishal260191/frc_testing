AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

there's 104 days of summer vacation
and school comes along just to end it

so the annual problem for our generation is finding a good way to spend it

LIKE MAYBE

building a rocket or fighting a mummy
or climbing up the eiffel tower

discovering something that doesn't exist
or giving a monkey a shower

surfing tidal waves
creating nanobots
or locating frankenstein's brain ("it's over here!")

finding a dodobird
painting a continent
or driving your sister insane ("phineas!")

so as you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do before school starts this fall
so stick with us, 'cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all

so stick with us, 'cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all!

"MOMMMMMMMM phineas and ferb are making a title sequence!"
